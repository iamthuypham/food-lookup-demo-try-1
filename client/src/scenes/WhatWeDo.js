    <h4 style={{padding: '2% 6%', lineHeight: '150%'}}>However, in developing countries, the economy is frequently not strong enough to provide free education for children. Their families have to pay. They also have to buy textbooks, uniforms and other educational materials themselves. In Vietnam,
    school fees range from VND 360,000 (US$19) per year for pupils who live in rural and mountainous areas, to VND 1,800,000 for pupils who live in big cities. Those costs are really a big burden to families who live in rural and mountainous areas,
    because their average income is only <span style={{color: '#f46600'}}>20,000 VND (US$1) per day</span> (or even less).
